Research experience
===============
* **Ph.D. Research** (Aug 2017 - Oct 2023)
  <p><i>(under the supervision of Associate Professor Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn)</i></p>
  INTERFACES Group in the School of Information Science and Technology (IST), Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology (VISTEC), Rayong, Thailand.
  * Developed MIN2Net, an end-to-end neural network utilizing 2-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs) for classifying imagined left and right-hand movements from brain signals (EEG), incorporating a multi-task autoencoder with deep metric learning (DML) and optimizing reconstruction, cross-entropy, and triplet loss functions to preserve discriminative brain signal representations.
  * Developed machine learning approaches, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to classify music preferences using brain responses (EEG) and heart responses (ECG), effectively predicting whether a listener favored or did not favor a song (Top 200 weekly chart of Thailand from renowned music streaming as Spotify).
  * Developed a support vector machine (SVM) model to accurately classify human movements based on brain signals during imagined sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions, demonstrating advanced machine learning applications in BCI technology.
  * Developed a machine learning approach for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that simultaneously estimates frequency and amplitude modulations of brain signals (SSVEPs) using filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) and support vector regression (SVR), enhancing control for neuromuscular patients.
* **Visiting Ph.D. Research** (Jan 2022 - Nov 2022)
  <p><i>(under the supervision of Professor Maarten De Vos)<p><i>
  Biomed Group in Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), Leuven, Belgium
  * Developed an advanced deep learning architecture for detecting seizure events in epilepsy patients, focusing on identifying anomaly events (seizure) in brain responses.
  * Explored strategies for handling imbalanced brain signals in epileptic seizure detection.
* **B.S. Research** (Aug 2013 - May 2017)
  <p><i>(under the supervision of Dr. Boonnak Sukhummek)</i></p>
  Chemistry Department, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand
  * Resolved the "delamination" issue in the integrated circuit.
