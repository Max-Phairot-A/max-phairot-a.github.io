I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in information science and technology with the [Bio-Inspired Robotics and Neural Engineering Laboratory](brain.vistec.ac.th), [School of Information Science and Technology](vistec.ist), [Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology](vistec.ac.th), Rayong, Thailand. I received the B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [College of Computing](https://computing.kku.ac.th/),[Khon Kaen University](kku.ac.th), Khon Kaen, Thailand, in 2018. I investigate topics in the fields of machine learning/deep learning and signal processing for brain-computer interfaces and assistive technology.
