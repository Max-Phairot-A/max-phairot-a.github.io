* **Top 10 finalist teams, GBU Gaskathon 2023 (Organized by PTT Public Company Limited (Gas Business Unit))**
    <p><i>Introduced Interflare system, an innovative solution leveraging machine learning algorithms trained on data from gas separation plant (GSP) sensors. Built on deep learning architectures, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, the Interflare system can interpret the top 20 most important GSP sensors correlated with gas flaring volumes. This system is strategically designed to minimize gas flaring volumes at the plant, effectively addressing both emergency situations and routine baseline flaring scenarios. This initiative demonstrates a commitment to enhancing operational efficiency and environmental sustainability in industrial gas processing.</i></p>
