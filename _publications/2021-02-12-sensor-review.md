This comprehensive review mainly analyzes and summarizes the recently published works on IEEExplore in sensor-driven smart living contexts. We have gathered over 150 research papers, especially in the past five years. We categorize them into four major research directions: activity tracker, affective computing, sleep monitoring, and ingestive behavior. We report each research direction's summary by following our defined sensor types: biomedical sensors, mechanical sensors, non-contact sensors, and others. Furthermore, the review behaves as one-stop service literature appropriate for novices who intend to research the direction of sensor-driven applications towards smart living. In conclusion, the state-of-the-art works, the publicity available data sources, and the future challenge issues (sensor selection, algorithms, and privacy) are the major contributions of this proposed article.
