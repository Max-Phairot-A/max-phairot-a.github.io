Non-invasive devices involved in the detection of drowsiness generally include infrared camera and Electroencephalography (EEG), of which sometimes are constrained in an actual real-life scenario deployments and implementations such as in the working office environment. This study proposes a combination using the biometric features of keyboard and mouse movements and eye tracking during an office-based tasks to detect and evaluate drowsiness according to the self-report Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) questionnaire. Using machine learning models, the results demonstrate a correlation between the predicted KSS from the biometrics and the actual KSS from the user input, indicating the feasibility of evaluating the office workers' drowsiness level of the proposed approach.
